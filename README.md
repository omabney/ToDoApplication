# Overview

As a Software developer, one of the most exciting thing is that I could make a person's day-to-day activities much easier and simpler. THis application will be an example for the above.

ToDo Application: This application will let a user to make a ToDo list. A user can add a new task to the ToDo list. Also User will have the option to view all the task , completed task and pending task.

By creating this application I was able to know more about node.js and express.js.

The data are stored in a database using Mongodb and the application will retrieve the required data from the database.
